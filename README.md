# Diabetic_detection_using_ANN

In this project I used Artificial neural network to build diabetic disease detection model based on past data of the patients

# Dataset 
The dataset used is taken from kaggale datasets. It is the PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATASET



The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the following attributes (TYNECKI, 2018):

1. Pregnancies (number of times pregnant),

2.Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl),

3.Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg),

4.Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm),

5.Insulin (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml),

6.BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2),

7.Age (years),

8.Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestorâ€™s history')

# Data descriptive analysis
To check the distribution pattern
To check relationship between independent variables
To check whether null values are present
To check any missing and outliers in the dataset



# Model build

ANN model is build with tensorflow and keras framework

 Model is trained for 120 epochs with adam optimizer
